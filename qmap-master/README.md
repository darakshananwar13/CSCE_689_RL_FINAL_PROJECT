# Reinfrocement-Learning-Project
## All Goal Update RL using CNN

- This repositary contains the code for our project in CSCE 689 Reinforcement Learning taught in Spring 
2020 by [Prof. Guni Sharon](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/guni/).
- Algorithm and results presented here are based on the paper 
[Scaling All-Goals Updates in Reinforcement Learning Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02927).
