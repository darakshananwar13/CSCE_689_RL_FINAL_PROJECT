# Reinfrocement-Learning-Project
## All Goal Update RL using CNN

- This repositary contains the code for our project in CSCE 689 Reinforcement Learning taught in Spring 
2020 by [Prof. Guni Sharon](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/guni/).
- Algorithm and results presented here are based on the paper 
[Scaling All-Goals Updates in Reinforcement Learning Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02927).

## Steps to follow for running the given source code 

1. Install  TensorFlow, Baselines, Gym and Gym Retro.
Please find the following snippet used for installing these in google colab.



2. Clone our respository
